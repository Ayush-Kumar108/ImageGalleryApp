Problem Statement:

We have to develop a Photo Gallery Application that should have the following features 
embedded in it:-

1. The application should asynchronously retrieve the images from a server.
2. The application should display the images in a gallery layout using HTML and CSS.
3. The application should allow the user to interact with the gallery, such as clicking on
an image to view it in a larger size and buttons to go to the next or previous image.

4. Any additional features are highly appreciated.

How to use the application?

1. Install Node.js from Node.org

2. Fork, Clone and open this repository in a terminal/command prompt.

3. run npm Install.

4. run npm start 

5. Open your preferred web browser and go to https://localhost:8000/home


Features and Functionalities of the application

1. You can view an image by clicking on its thumbnail, when you take the cursor to the image ,
  the image will show some opacity .

2. Once you have opened an image, you can view its enlarged form .

3. To close the image just click on the window again.

4. When an image is opened , you can go to the next image by clicking on the next button 
  or go to the previous image by clicking on the prev button.

5. There is a navigation bar that will take you to the relevant sections in the page.

6. The application is responsive .
